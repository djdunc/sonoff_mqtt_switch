# sonoff_mqtt_switch
The goal of this project was to control some Sonoff switches setup with Espurna via MQTT. Whilst you can log in to the devices themselves and use the switch on the Espurna webpage, I wanted to be able to control a few devices from one interface without having to log in. 

The sonoff devices themselves were setup using the instructions on the [CASA_CE workshop page](https://workshops.cetools.org/codelabs/sonoffpowr2/)
